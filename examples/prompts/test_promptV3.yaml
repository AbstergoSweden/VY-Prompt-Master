identity: VY Prompt Engineering Persona
purpose: >-
  Generate highly explicit, UI-grounded, stepwise, reversible-first,
  evidence-backed prompt specifications that enable VY to execute tasks safely,
  deterministically, and robustly.
context:
  platform: VY (Vercept) automation agent on macOS
  access_method: desktop UI automation (can include web interactions via browser)
  auth_state: user_logged_in_as_needed
  environment: "macOS (version unspecified), user's default browser"
inputs:
  - name: user_task_description
    required: true
    description: >-
      High-level natural language description of the UI automation task for VY
      to execute.
    example: >-
      Open Safari, navigate to vercept.com, capture the main headline, and then
      close Safari.
task:
  goal: >-
    Execute a UI automation task, ensuring explicit, UI-grounded, stepwise,
    reversible-first, and evidence-backed actions are defined.
  steps:
    - step_id: step_001_launch_browser
      intent: Launch the user's default web browser.
      locate: >-
        Visible 'Safari' or 'Chrome' application icon in the macOS Dock or
        Applications folder, or the system's default browser executable.
      confirm_target: >-
        An active application window corresponding to the default browser
        appears in the foreground, with its title bar visible.
      act: >-
        If a browser icon is present in the Dock, click the 'Safari' or 'Chrome'
        icon. Otherwise, use the 'open_application' tool with the name of the
        default browser (e.g., 'Safari').
      verify_outcome: >-
        The selected browser is the active application, and a new window or tab
        is open.
      fallback_paths:
        - >-
          If direct click fails, attempt to use the 'open_application' tool with
          the browser's full application path or common name.
      safety_gate: safe
    - step_id: step_002_navigate_url
      intent: Navigate to the specified target URL.
      locate: >-
        The active browser window's address bar (e.g., a text field labeled
        'Search or enter address' or showing the current URL).
      confirm_target: >-
        The address bar is visibly focused and editable, or a new blank tab is
        open with a prominent, editable address bar.
      act: >-
        First, erase any pre-existing text in the address bar (Knowledge 3).
        Then, type 'https://vercept.com/' into the address bar and press the
        Return key (Knowledge 3).
      verify_outcome: >-
        The browser's URL bar accurately displays 'https://vercept.com/' AND a
        key visual element of the Vercept website (e.g., the company logo or a
        prominent headline) is rendered on screen.
      fallback_paths:
        - >-
          If the address bar is not found or typing fails, use the 'open_url'
          tool directly with 'https://vercept.com/' (Knowledge 2).
        - >-
          If page load issues, wait progressively (250ms, then 500ms, then
          1000ms) and retry navigating once (Knowledge 2, 3).
      safety_gate: safe
    - step_id: step_003_extract_headline
      intent: Identify and extract the main headline from the loaded webpage.
      locate: >-
        A prominent text element on the webpage that appears to be the main
        headline, characterized by large font size, central positioning, or
        explicit semantic tagging (e.g., likely containing text like 'VY AI
        Automation Agent' or similar).
      confirm_target: >-
        The identified element is visually the largest and most central text
        block within the visible screen area, indicating it is the primary
        headline for the page.
      act: >-
        Use screen vision to read and capture the visible text content of the
        identified UI element (Conduct Deep Research, Knowledge 2).
      verify_outcome: >-
        The extracted text content is non-empty, formatted as a string, and its
        length and content are consistent with a typical webpage headline.
      fallback_paths:
        - >-
          If no single clear headline is found, identify the largest visible
          text block on the page that appears to be a heading.
        - >-
          If text extraction fails, take a screenshot of the area and use OCR to
          extract text (Knowledge 2).
      safety_gate: safe
    - step_id: step_004_report_headline
      intent: Output the extracted headline to the user.
      locate: >-
        Not applicable; this is an internal process to format and present the
        information.
      confirm_target: Not applicable; output is generated internally.
      act: >-
        Format the extracted headline as a string and prepare it for final
        output.
      verify_outcome: >-
        The headline string is prepared correctly, matches the extracted
        content, and is ready for display.
      fallback_paths: []
      safety_gate: safe
    - step_id: step_005_close_browser_checkpoint
      intent: Close the browser application after completing the task.
      locate: >-
        The active browser window's close button (e.g., the red 'X' or '•' icon
        in the top-left corner on macOS), or the application's 'Quit' menu item.
      confirm_target: >-
        The target is clearly the browser application's close button or quit
        option, not another application.
      act: >-
        Click the browser window's close button, or if the window is
        unresponsive, use the 'quit_application' tool for the browser.
      verify_outcome: >-
        The browser application is no longer visible in the foreground, and its
        icon in the Dock may disappear or dim, indicating it has closed or quit.
      fallback_paths:
        - >-
          If clicking the close button fails, attempt to use the
          'quit_application' tool with the browser's name.
      safety_gate: caution
constraints:
  - Minimal output outside the YAML prompt spec.
  - Reason internally; do not print chain-of-thought.
  - Ask clarifying questions only if blocking.
  - >-
    Before irreversible actions (delete/send/pay/post), require explicit user
    confirmation.
  - Do not claim tool access/integrations unless provided.
  - >-
    If citations requested, cite only user-provided sources or
    explicitly-permitted browsing results.
  - 'Prefer UI-grounded steps: locate → confirm → act → verify.'
  - Use reversible actions first; create checkpoints; include rollback guidance.
  - 'Use short, atomic steps; one intent per step.'
assumptions:
  - id: vy_local_agent_presence
    statement: >-
      VY runs as a local agent on the user's macOS computer with necessary
      permissions to interact with the UI.
    confidence: high
    risk: >-
      Agent may not be available, or its UI interactions might be blocked by
      system security settings.
    mitigation: >-
      The prompt specification itself instructs VY to take UI actions; the
      system's operational readiness is assumed.
    verification_method: >-
      VY's ability to successfully execute the first UI action (e.g., launching
      an application).
  - id: vy_ui_grounding_capability
    statement: >-
      VY can reliably identify and interact with on-screen UI elements (buttons,
      text fields, links, specific text blocks) based on textual descriptions
      and visual context (screen vision technology).
    confidence: high
    risk: >-
      Steps may be non-actionable or target incorrect UI elements due to dynamic
      UI, resolution changes, or visual ambiguities (Conduct Deep Research).
    mitigation: >-
      Each step includes explicit locate, confirm_target, and verify_outcome
      directives. Fallback paths are provided for common failures. VY's adaptive
      scrolling and error recovery mechanisms are leveraged (Knowledge 2, 3).
    verification_method: >-
      Observable visual changes on screen after an action, and specific data
      extraction matching expectations.
  - id: macOS_environment_conventions
    statement: >-
      The target system is macOS, and standard macOS UI conventions (e.g.,
      Command key for shortcuts, typical window controls, file system paths)
      apply.
    confidence: high
    risk: >-
      Incorrect keyboard shortcuts or UI interaction patterns might be
      attempted.
    mitigation: >-
      Specify actions using macOS-appropriate terminology and conventions. VY
      has deep macOS platform awareness (Knowledge 1, 3).
    verification_method: >-
      Successful interaction with macOS-specific UI elements and consistent
      application behavior.
  - id: browser_default_availability
    statement: >-
      The user has a functional default web browser (e.g., Safari, Chrome)
      installed and configured on macOS, and it opens consistently to display
      web content.
    confidence: medium
    risk: >-
      Web navigation steps could fail if no default browser is set, or if an
      unusual/unsupported browser is in use.
    mitigation: >-
      Prioritize robust UI-grounding for browser launch and navigation
      (Knowledge 2). Include fallbacks for direct URL opening. VY can specify a
      browser in tool calls (Knowledge 3).
    verification_method: Browser window appears and correctly loads the target URL.
output_format:
  type: yaml
  structure: >
    YAML dictionary with top-level keys: identity, purpose, context, inputs,
    task, constraints, assumptions, output_format, self_check,
    robustness_improvements, validation_tests, failure_playbooks.

    The 'task' key contains a list of 'steps', each adhering to the
    required_fields_per_step defined in the persona.
  evidence_requirements:
    - >-
      For each completed step, an internal evidence_ledger must record
      what_observed, where_observed, and why_it_matters.
    - >-
      Screenshots must be taken before and after critical UI state-changing
      actions or before any user confirmation prompts to capture observable
      evidence.
robustness_improvements:
  retries:
    - condition: >-
        UI element (as defined by 'locate') not found after the initial attempt
        or an action produces no visible result (Knowledge 3).
      max_attempts: 2
      backoff: >-
        progressive timing strategy: 250ms initial wait, then increase to 500ms
        or 1000ms if needed (Knowledge 2, 3).
      recovery_action: >-
        If a UI element is not found, attempt to reposition the mouse cursor
        over a potentially scrollable area or search region before retrying. If
        a specific tool fails, attempt alternative tool for same intent
        (Knowledge 3).
    - condition: >-
        Web page content fails to load fully or displays unexpected errors after
        navigation.
      max_attempts: 1
      backoff: 5 seconds
      recovery_action: >-
        Refresh the page and re-verify content. If persistent, retry 'open_url'
        tool from last known good state.
  rollbacks:
    - trigger: >-
        Failure during step 'step_005_close_browser_checkpoint' or any critical
        error that prevents graceful task completion.
      procedure: >-
        Attempt to close the browser (if still open) via 'quit_application'
        tool. Report 'Task aborted; browser closed' or 'Task aborted; unexpected
        error encountered before completion'.
      reversibility_level: full_reversion_for_browser_state
  monitoring:
    - checkpoint: step_003_extract_headline
      evidence: The successfully extracted headline text.
      summary_point: Successfully extracted the main headline from vercept.com.
self_check:
  - >-
    Verify all required_keys (identity, purpose, context, inputs, task,
    constraints, output_format, self_check) are present in the generated YAML.
  - >-
    Confirm every action step (within 'task.steps') explicitly uses the locate →
    confirm_target → act → verify_outcome pattern with observable evidence
    specified for 'verify_outcome'.
  - >-
    Ensure irreversible actions (e.g., delete, send, pay, post) are explicitly
    gated with a 'safety_gate: irreversible_requires_confirmation' and a
    preceding user confirmation step (if applicable for a real task).
  - >-
    Validate that no claims of tool access/integrations are made by the persona,
    and actions are phrased as instructions for VY to execute, not as already
    completed actions.
  - >-
    Check that all UI actions are grounded in observable on-screen elements, and
    each critical step includes at least one 'fallback_paths' entry.
  - >-
    Confirm all assumptions are documented within the 'assumptions' section,
    including 'id', 'statement', 'confidence', 'risk', 'mitigation', and
    'verification_method'.
  - >-
    Ensure the output is strictly valid YAML without any extraneous text,
    preambles, commentary, quotes, or code fences.
  - >-
    Verify the 'robustness_improvements' section correctly incorporates retry
    logic, rollback procedures, and monitoring checkpoints as described in the
    Knowledge files.
  - >-
    Ensure 'validation_tests' and 'failure_playbooks' are included as per the
    schema, providing comprehensive guidance for robust automation.
validation_tests:
  schema_tests:
    - >-
      All required_keys (identity, purpose, context, inputs, task, constraints,
      output_format, self_check) are present at the top level.
    - >-
      No unknown top-level keys exist beyond those explicitly allowed by the
      persona's 'optional_keys' (e.g., 'assumptions', 'robustness_improvements',
      'validation_tests', 'failure_playbooks').
    - >-
      Data types for all fields (e.g., lists, scalars, booleans) match the
      schema expectations.
  ui_tests:
    - >-
      Every individual action step within 'task.steps' explicitly includes
      'locate', 'confirm_target', and 'verify_outcome' fields.
    - >-
      Any step identified as potentially irreversible has a 'safety_gate' set to
      'irreversible_requires_confirmation' (demonstrated in hypothetical use
      cases).
  safety_tests:
    - >-
      The prompt specification contains no instructions for bypass, jailbreak,
      evasion, or circumvention of security policies.
    - >-
      There are no instructions facilitating credential harvesting, privacy
      invasion, or stealth operations; instead, manual user authentication is
      specified if login is required.
  determinism_tests:
    - >-
      The persona's output consists solely of instructions/specifications for
      VY, without any claims of having completed actions itself.
    - >-
      Vague verbs without clear UI referents (e.g., 'handle it', 'process it')
      are avoided; instead, concrete, observable actions ('click', 'type',
      'select') are used.
failure_playbooks:
  - name: ui_not_found
    detection: >-
      An element targeted by 'locate' cannot be found on the screen after the
      initial attempt and one additional retry (Knowledge 3).
    response:
      - >-
        Execute the 'fallback_paths' for the current step in the specified
        priority order.
      - >-
        If all fallbacks are exhausted and the element is critical, attempt a
        broad search within the application's menus or search functionality if
        contextually available.
      - >-
        If still blocking, capture a screenshot and request one clarifying
        screenshot/description from the user, then pause for human input.
  - name: unexpected_modal
    detection: >-
      A modal window or dialog box appears and interrupts the current workflow,
      obscuring target UI elements or demanding immediate interaction.
    response:
      - >-
        Identify the modal's title and the labels of its primary/secondary
        buttons (e.g., 'OK', 'Cancel', 'Save', 'Delete').
      - >-
        Prefer to click a 'Cancel' or 'Close' button unless the modal's function
        is absolutely required for the task's progress.
      - >-
        If the modal contains destructive wording (e.g., 'Delete Permanently',
        'Confirm Payment'), immediately set 'safety_gate' to
        'irreversible_requires_confirmation' and prompt the user for explicit
        confirmation before any action on the modal.
  - name: auth_blocked
    detection: >-
      The system detects a login prompt, session expiration message, or
      redirection to an authentication page, indicating that VY's access is
      blocked without user credentials.
    response:
      - >-
        Immediately halt current automation steps to prevent any unauthorized or
        unintended interactions.
      - >-
        Inform the user that authentication is required, stating 'Authentication
        required. Please log in manually to proceed.' (Knowledge 1, 3).
      - >-
        After the user confirms they have successfully logged in, resume
        automation from the last successfully completed checkpoint to ensure
        continuity.
