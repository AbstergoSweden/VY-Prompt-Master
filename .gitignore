# ---- NotesAndExtendedConfiguration ----
# Excludes Obsidian workspace cache and plugin code, but retains plugin
# configuration. All notes and user-controlled configuration files are tracked
# by Git.
#
# 				!!! WARNING !!!
#
# Community plugins may store sensitive secrets in their data.json files. By
# including these files, those secrets may be tracked in your Git repository.
#
# To ignore configurations for specific plugins, add a line like this after the
# contents of this file (order is important):
#     .obsidian/plugins/{{plugin_name}}/data.json
#
# Alternatively, ensure that you are treating your entire Git repository as
# sensitive data, since it may contain secrets, or may have contained them in
# past commits.  Understand your threat profile, and make the decision
# appropriate for yourself. If in doubt, err on the side of not including
# plugin configuration. Use one of the alternative gitignore files instead:
# * NotesOnly.gitignore
# * NotesAndCoreConfiguration.gitignore

# The current application UI state (DOM layout, recently-opened files, etc.) is
# stored in these files (separate for desktop and mobile) so you can resume
# your session seamlessly after a restart. If you want to track UI state, use
# the Workspaces core plugin instead of relying on these files.
.obsidian/workspace.json
.obsidian/workspace-mobile.json

# Obsidian plugins are stored under .obsidian/plugins/$plugin_name. They
# contain metadata (manifest.json), application code (main.js), stylesheets
# (styles.css), and user-configuration data (data.json).
# We only want to track data.json, so we:
# 1. exclude everything that the plugin folders contain,
# 2. unignore data.json in the plugin folders
.obsidian/plugins/*/**
!.obsidian/plugins/*/data.json
