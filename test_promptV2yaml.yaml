identity: "VY_Senior_Automation_Specialist"

purpose: "Orchestrate a high-fidelity cleanup, quality assurance, and formatting standardization workflow for a mixed-content directory containing 29 miscellaneous documents."

context:
  platform: "macOS"
  access_method: "local_agent"
  auth_state: "authenticated_user"
  environment: "Finder / File System"
  target_directory: "file:///Users/super_user/Desktop/Snippets/"

inputs:
  - name: "target_path"
    required: true
    value: "/Users/super_user/Desktop/Snippets/"
    description: "Absolute path to the target directory containing snippets."
  - name: "file_count"
    required: true
    value: 29
    description: "Expected number of files to process."

task:
  goal: "Analyze, validate, and standardize 29 documents/scripts within the Snippets folder, ensuring code quality for scripts and formatting consistency for text."
  steps:
    - step_id: "step_001_safety_backup"
      intent: "Create a full backup of the target directory before modification to ensure reversibility."
      locate: "Folder 'Snippets' at /Users/super_user/Desktop/"
      confirm_target: "Verify folder exists and contains approximately 29 items."
      act: "Duplicate 'Snippets' folder to 'Snippets_Backup_YYYYMMDD'."
      verify_outcome: "Backup folder exists and has same item count as source."
      fallback_paths:
        - "Create 'Snippets_Backup' directory and copy files individually."
      safety_gate: "irreversible_requires_confirmation"

    - step_id: "step_002_inventory_and_planning"
      intent: "Catalog all files to populate the internal execution plan."
      locate: "Target directory contents."
      confirm_target: "List of files matches expectation (approx 29)."
      act: "List all files in target path. Create memory file 'TODO.md' with a checkbox item for each filename."
      verify_outcome: "'TODO.md' exists in memory containing 29 unchecked items."
      fallback_paths:
        - "Read directory listing to memory, then parse into TODO format."
      safety_gate: "safe"

    - step_id: "step_003_iterative_processing"
      intent: "Process each file: Identify Type -> Analyze Quality -> Fix/Format -> Save."
      locate: "Next unchecked item in 'TODO.md'."
      confirm_target: "File exists at path."
      act: |
        Loop through TODO list:
        1. Read file content.
        2. Identify file type (Python, JS, Markdown, Plaintext, etc.).
        3. IF CODE: Check for syntax errors, missing comments, and poor naming. Refactor for readability.
        4. IF TEXT: Check for formatting consistency, spelling, and structure. Apply markdown formatting if applicable.
        5. Overwrite file with improved content (or create new version if heavily modified).
        6. Mark item checked in 'TODO.md'.
      verify_outcome: "File timestamp updated; content length/structure improved; TODO item marked complete."
      fallback_paths:
        - "Skip file if unreadable/binary and log to 'skipped_files.md'."
      safety_gate: "caution"

    - step_id: "step_004_organization_consolidation"
      intent: "Organize files into subfolders by type if the root folder is cluttered."
      locate: "Snippets folder root."
      confirm_target: "Mixed file types present."
      act: "Create subfolders (e.g., 'Scripts', 'Notes', 'Misc') and move processed files into appropriate categories."
      verify_outcome: "Files moved to valid subdirectories; root folder clean."
      fallback_paths:
        - "Leave files in root but prefix names (e.g., 'script_name.py')."
      safety_gate: "safe"

    - step_id: "step_005_final_report"
      intent: "Generate a summary of actions taken and files modified."
      locate: "Memory logs."
      confirm_target: "Processing complete."
      act: "Create 'Cleanup_Report.md' listing all files processed, actions taken (e.g., 'Fixed syntax', 'Reformatted'), and location of backup."
      verify_outcome: "Report file exists and is readable."
      fallback_paths:
        - "Output summary to chat conversation."
      safety_gate: "safe"

constraints:
  - "Must preserve original logic of code snippets (no functional changes without explicit user approval)."
  - "Must create a backup before any modification."
  - "Must handle 29 files; do not stop until all are processed or flagged as skipped."
  - "Use 'TODO.md' for tracking progress as task exceeds 20 actions."

assumptions:
  - id: "asm_001"
    statement: "User has write permissions to the Desktop/Snippets directory."
    confidence: "high"
    risk: "Permission denied errors."
    mitigation: "Check permissions before start; ask user to sudo or chmod if needed."
    verification_method: "Try creating a test file."
  - id: "asm_002"
    statement: "Files are text-readable (scripts/docs) and not binary assets (images/binaries)."
    confidence: "medium"
    risk: "Corrupting binary files by treating them as text."
    mitigation: "Check file extension and header before reading/writing."
    verification_method: "Skip if extension is .png, .jpg, .exe, .bin, etc."

output_format:
  type: "yaml"
  structure: "VY_Task_Spec"
  evidence_requirements: "Backup folder path, final file count, link to Cleanup_Report.md."

robustness_improvements:
  retries:
    - condition: "File read/write lock"
      max_attempts: 3
      backoff: "exponential"
  rollbacks:
    - trigger: "Critical data loss or corruption detected during batch process."
      procedure: "Restore from 'Snippets_Backup_YYYYMMDD' and halt."
  monitoring:
    - checkpoint: "step_001_safety_backup"
      evidence: "Screenshot of backup folder."
    - checkpoint: "step_003_iterative_processing"
      evidence: "Log entry for each file processed."

self_check:
  - "Is the backup step mandatory and gated?"
  - "Does the plan handle the specific count of 29 files via a tracked list?"
  - "Are file type checks included to prevent corrupting binaries?"
  - "Is the output purely YAML?"
